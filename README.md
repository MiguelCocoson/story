# Overview

This website works locally by running a database. The first step is to open a terminal and type "python manage.py runserver".
Then go to the web browser and type http://127.0.0.1:8000/
And the website should be ready to run.

I wrote this website because I know people that love interactive stories in which what happens next is determine by the reader.

# Web Pages

This web app uses Django to get user input and display something diferent depending on the input.
In this case a set of multiple choices were created which each provided another choices, and depending
on the first choice, the website will redirect to a different page with specific options from the previous choice.

# Development Environment

I used VScode and Google Chrome.

I used Python, HTML and Django with the libraries shortcuts, http and urls.

# Future Work

* I need to display all the results from all the options.
* I have to add better CSS.
* I need to make the story more interesting and dynamic.
